Transistors, 
basically it's about hardware 
yeah
hardware

transistor? 3 wires in is first hint
prof isn't an electrical engineer
dislikes electrical engineering, but we need to understand the hardware at a high level

will be looking at 8 bit chip 

transistor is a solid state device to amplify or switch electric signals

light switch = Physical Switch 
Transistor = Electronic switch using material science, pretty crazy stuff
Julius lilienfeld proposed transistor and bell labs built the first one in 1947

William Shockley (Grandfather of silicon valley) was on the team

never gonna see anything on a quiz that isn't in his notes. Very handy, review before notes on. Guess who's done taking notes!
